I need to add to the VC claim a new property called "rid". This is call the Revocation Idenitfier.
This Idenitfier will be the first 64 chars of a hash or the FHIR Bundel payload, yet that is still to be confirmed. In reality it just needs to be unquie such as a GUID, yet it MUST be no more then 24 char long, GUIDS are 36.
See the image from Grahame in the soution named: RevocationScreenshot 2021-11-24 103711.png
